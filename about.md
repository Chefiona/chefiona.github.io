I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at the Institute of Linguistics at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I'm interested in discovering any systematic patterns behind languages -- in syntax, semantics, and computational Linguistics. I graduated with an MA in Linguistics in 2016. My paper topic is about the predictions of Entropy Reduction on Chinese relative clauses. I have also done the other courses besides Linguistics -- Machine Learning, Algorithms and Data Structure, Computational Syntax and Semantics in Haskell.
